# CinaSearch

## Purpose
A movie search application that obtains movie-related data from the OMDb and Youtube APIs. Developed with a group of five other students in the Coding Boot Camp at UT Austin. 

## Features
Application accepts user input and displays information associated with a movie that matches the searched word, if one exists. The application also allows the user to view a trailer for the featured movie. Lastly, the user can add the movie to their watch list, which will save to local storage and remain on the page for the user to view again if they wish.

## Built With
* HTML
* CSS
* Bulma (CSS framework)
* JavaScript
* OMDb API
* YouTube API

## Role
My contribution to this project consisted of writing most of the HTML and CSS for the application. I created the layout and overall appearance using a combination of Bulma and external CSS styles.
